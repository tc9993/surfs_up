<h1>Surfs Up Analysis</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<h3>Overview of the Analysis</h3>
<p>
  After working with W.Avy on getting all of the temperature data together for Oahu, it was decided that, to determine whether or not a surf and ice cream shop would be a viable business, gathering and analyzing temperature data for June and December would be necessary.
</p>
<p>
  To do this, python, along with Pandas, and SQLAlchemy, was used to retrieve the temperature data via reflecting an SQLite database and leveraging the session.query() method.
