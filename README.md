<h1>Surfs Up Analysis</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<h3>Overview of the Analysis</h3>
<p>
  After working with W.Avy on getting all of the temperature data together for Oahu, it was decided that, to determine whether or not a surf and ice cream shop would be a viable business, gathering and analyzing temperature data for June and December would be necessary.
</p>
<p>
  To do this, python, along with Pandas, and SQLAlchemy, was used to retrieve the temperature data via reflecting an SQLite database and leveraging the session.query() method.

<ul>
<li>The difference in average temperature between June and December is only 4 degrees different (75 vs. 71 respectively).  This means there is minimal fluctuation throughout the year in temperature.  Additionally, with the average temperature seemingly in the low to mid 70s year-round ice cream is not out of the question as a treat on an average day in December.</li>
